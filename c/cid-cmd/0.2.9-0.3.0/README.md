 past 24 hours. An SQL Server database has a compute capacity limit for each
 instance. An instance with SQL Server Standard edition can use up to 48 vCPUs.
 An instance with SQL Server Web can use up to 32 vCPUs. This check alerts you
 if an instance exceeds this vCPU limit.If your instance is over-provisioned,
 you pay full price without realizing an improvement in performance. You can
 manage the number and size of your instances to help lower costs. Estimated
 monthly savings are calculated by using the same instance family with the
 maximum number of vCPUs that an SQL Server instance can use and the On-Demand
 pricing. Actual savings will vary if youâre using Reserved Instances (RI) or
 if the instance isnât running for a full day.
